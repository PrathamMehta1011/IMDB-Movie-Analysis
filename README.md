## 📊 Dataset & Scope

- The dataset contains movies with attributes such as **title**, **release year**, **genre**, **rating**, **votes**, **duration**, **gross revenue**, etc.  
- The scope of the analysis involves:
  - Exploring distributions: e.g., ratings by genre, decade, country  
  - Investigating relationships: e.g., number of votes vs rating, budget/gross vs rating  
  - Charting trends over time and across categories  
  - Producing visualizations and actionable insights based only on Excel (no code-based models)

## 🧮 Workflow & Methods

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Cleaned dataset: handled missing values, filtered/unified categories (genres, years)  
   - Imported into Excel workbook for analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Excel)**  
   - Built pivot tables & charts: ratings by year, top-genres by average rating, vote‐counts by genre  
   - Created visualizations: bar charts, scatter plots, trend lines  

3. **Insights & Interpretation**  
   - Identified key trends such as:  
     - Which genres tend to have higher ratings  
     - Relationship between vote count and rating  
     - Release year-wise shifts in film duration or rating  
   - Compiled observations, hypotheses, and recommendations  

4. **Presentation of Findings**  
   - Saved charts and tables in the `results/` folder  
   - Optionally: created a summary slide or sheet within Excel summarising major findings

## 📝 Key Highlights (example insights)

- Movies in genre **X** have on average higher rating than genre **Y**.  
- There is a positive correlation between the number of votes and the rating (movies with more votes tend to score higher).  
- The duration of movies has increased over decades, and longer films in recent years tend to get higher vote counts.  
- Recommendation: For production houses, investing in genre **X** and promoting films early to gather vote momentum could favour rating performance.
